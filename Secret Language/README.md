#🕵️‍♂️ Secret Language 🔐

✨ Description

The Secret Language is a Python program that encodes and decodes messages based on specific rules. It can be used to convert text into a secret language and decode it back.

🚀 Features

Encodes text by rearranging characters and adding random letters.

Decodes the encoded text back to its original form.

Uses a simple algorithm to transform messages securely.

🔑 How It Works

Encoding: If a word has at least 3 characters, the first letter is moved to the end, and three random characters are added at the start and end. If it's shorter, it's simply reversed.

Decoding: If a word has fewer than 3 characters, it is reversed. Otherwise, the extra characters are removed, and the last letter is moved back to the start.
